# With conditions, we can now decide which parts of our code to run based on a test. Below, you can experiment with conditions. Try also utilizing else if and else statements.


a = 5
b = 5

if a == b:
    print("a is equal to b")

if a > b:
    print("a is greater than b")

if a < b:
    print("a is less than b")

if a != b:
    print("a doesn't equal b")

if a >= b:
    print("a is greater than or equals to b")

if a <= b:
    print("a is less than or equals to b")
